# Neutron_Reflect
Python/PyTorch codes to analyze neutron reflectivity curves

Analyzes a set of simulated neutron reflectivity curves with an autoencoder, and uses a multilayer perceptron to determine the relation between latent variables and the inputs parameters used to created the simulated curves.
